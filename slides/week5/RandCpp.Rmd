# Why would you want to use another language?
- R is great, but it has some weaknesses
    - For example, loops can be slow
- It is sometimes desirable to call code written in other languages from R.
- Also, you may want to call R from a another language
- R interfaces have been developed for a number of other languages
    - We will focus on C/C++
- The main motivation in performance enhancement
    - C/C++ code may run much faster than R
    
# Writing C/C++ Functions to be called from R
- Key points to remember:
    - All the argurments passedd from R to C/C++ are received by C/C++ as pointers
    - The C/C++ function itself must return `void`
        - Hence, we need to pass a pointer for the result
    - For R to work with C++ code (or even C code compiled with g++), you need to wrap
your functions inside an an extern statement: extern “C” { yourC++_code_here....
} (or just declare with extern statement)
- We will learn to compile code using R (via gcc and g++) and Visual C++.
- The end product is a dynamic shared library file (.so) on Linux/OS X or a dynamic-link library
    - DLLs are a common way to incorporate number-crunching C++ code in a front-end like R or Excel.

# Required software
- On windows, you need to install Rtools, available [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
    - Just choose the version that matches your computer architecture (i.e. 64 bit or 32 bit)
    - You have the make sure Rtools is in you path (may need to restart)
- Please verify:
    - On Linux you need to have GNU gcc and g++ (probably already installed)
        - Do you need r-base-dev?
    - On OS X, you may need Xcode.

# Our program: `timesTwo.cpp`
\Large
```{Rcpp, eval=FALSE}
extern "C" void
  timesTwo(double *in, double *out)
{
  double value = in[0] * 2.0;
	out[0] = value;
}
```

# What does `extern "C"` do?
- Remember R is written in C.
- `extern "C"` makes our C++ function available to a program written in C (i.e. R).
    - It declares the functions with C linkage
    - If we write a C program, we don't need it
- Note that the parameter and return types are constained.
    - For example, cannot write a function that passes a (nontrivial) C++ class to a C program
    - The C program would not know what to do about the contructors, destructors, and other class-specific operations.
    ```{Rcpp, eval=FALSE}
extern "C" void
  timesTwo(double *in, double *out)
{
  double value = in[0] * 2.0;
	out[0] = value;
}
```


# Compile using R's command line tools
- In R, you can type:
```{r,}
system("R CMD SHLIB ./examples/timesTwo.cpp")
```
- Or, on the command line:

\centerline{
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=0.4\textheight,keepaspectratio]{./figures/RcmdSHLIB}
}

- Now we have timesTwo.dll (or timesTwo.so) ready to use in R

# Now run the DLL in R
```{r}
dyn.load("./examples/timesTwo.dll")
value_in <- 32; value_out <- 0
.C("timesTwo", as.double(value_in), 
   res=as.double(value_out))$res
dyn.unload("./examples/timesTwo.dll")
```
- `dyn.load` loads the .dll into R
- `.C` calls timesTwo, and passes value_in and value_out to the function
    - `.C` returns a list, so we define 'result' and extract 'result' from the list
- `dyn.unload` unloads the .dll from R (you need the unload the dll if you want to rebuild it).

# Creating a DLL project in Visual Studio 2015

# Project at This Point

# Add a C++ Source File
-Right-click Source Files in the Solution Explorer, then select Add New Item, and then select C++ File (.cpp)

\centerline{
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=0.7\textheight,keepaspectratio]{./figures/addNewItem}
}

# Add C++ Code to the Source File
\LARGE
```{Rcpp, eval=FALSE}
extern "C" void __cdecl 
  timesTwo(double *in, double *out)
{
  double value = in[0] * 2.0;
	out[0] = value;
}
```


# What is `__cdecl` about?
- Applies only to Windows.
- The Visual C++ compilers allow you to specify conventions for passing arguments and return values between functions and callers.
- Two options we care about:
    - **`__cdecl`** is used by C/C++ programs, R, Matlab, SAS, others.
    - **`__stdcall`** is used by Excel, Win32 API fuctions, Pascal, others.
- This all essentially amounts to conventions for who (function caller or function) pops arguments off the stack.
- For more information, see [this webpage](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/984x0h58.aspx).
```{Rcpp, eval=FALSE}
extern "C" void __cdecl 
  timesTwo(double *in, double *out)
{
  double value = in[0] * 2.0;
  out[0] = value;
}
```

# Why are we using pointers?
- In C++ `timesTwo(double& in, double& out)` works as well
```{Rcpp, eval=FALSE}
extern "C" void __cdecl 
  timesTwo(double *in, double *out)
{
  double value = in[0] * 2.0;
  out[0] = value;
}
```

# Add a Module Definition File (.def)
- Add New Item...Under Visual C++ / Code you will find the .def file.

\centerline{
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=0.7\textheight,keepaspectratio]{./figures/defFile.png}
}

# Module Definition File 
- A .def file is a module definition file. This is a convenient way to tell the linker which parts of our C++ code we want to export.

```{Rcpp, eval=FALSE}
// timesTwo.def
LIBRARY timesTwoDLL
EXPORTS
  timesTwo
```

- `LIBRARY` is the name of the DLL
- `EXPORTS` lists the functions to be exported (each one on a seprate line)
    - If you want to use a different function name use `newName = oldName`
    
# Another option: `__declspec(dllexport)`
- Windows-specific.
- On Windows, we need to tell which functions are exported from the DLL.
    - That is, which funtions will be available in R.
- we 
- When building your DLL, you typically create a header file that contains the functions you are exporting and add `__declspec(dllexport)` to the declarations in the header file.
- For more information, see [this.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/a90k134d.aspx)
- Instead of `__declspec(dllexport)`, you can use a [DEF file.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/d91k01sh.aspx)
    
    
# Build the Solution
- Make sure to change the architecture to x64 before building (unless you are using 32bit R)
![](./figures/x64.PNG)
- Ctrl-Shift-B builds the solution.
- The DLL is found in the ./x64/Debug folder
![](./figures/DLL.PNG)

# Add an R project to Visual Studio
- Right click the solution...Add...New Project...Other Languages...R project

\centerline{
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=0.7\textheight,keepaspectratio]{./figures/timesTwoR.PNG}
}

# Now run the DLL in R
- `dyn.load` loads the .dll into R
- `.C` calls timesTwo, and passes value_in and value_out to the function
    - `.C` returns a list, so we define 'result' and extract 'result' from the list
- `dyn.unload` loads the .dll into R
    - you need the unload the dll if you want to rebuild it.
    
\centerline{
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=0.8\textheight,keepaspectratio]{./figures/DLLinR.PNG}
}

# Let's change the code for Excel
- We don't need `extern "C"` anymore
- The function can return a double
- We need to use `__stdcall`
- Make sure the build matches the Excel version (x64 or x86)
- the .def file remains the same
```{Rcpp, eval=FALSE}
double __stdcall timesTwo(double *in)
{
	double value = in[0] * 2.0;
	return value;
}
```

# In Excel
- Alt-F11 opens the VBA editor window. Right click on wookbook, Insert/Module
- We’ll add a declaration for the function in the DLL.

\centerline{
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=0.8\textheight,keepaspectratio]{./figures/vba.png}
}

- Now we can use the function in Excel

# Rcpp
- I wanted to show you how build a DLL in visual studio, because it can be useful for more complicated projects
- Often it is easiest to use the Rcpp package instead.
- RCpp makes it easy to pass vectors, matricies, lists, ect, back to R.
    - However, there is overhead in doing this.
    - If you are concerned about speed, consider using the simplest structure 

# Rcpp Example
1. In RStudio, File / New File / C++ File.
2. Enter code in timesTwoRcpp.cpp
```{Rcpp, eval=FALSE}
#include <Rcpp.h>
// [[Rcpp::export]]
Rcpp::NumericVector timesTwo(Rcpp::NumericVector x) {
  return x * 2;
}
```
3. In R,
```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(Rcpp)
Rcpp::sourceCpp("./examples/timesTwoRcpp.cpp")
timesTwo(c(32,64))
```

# Using R's Library
- Check out R-3.3.0\\include
    - In that folder there are several header files with functions we can use in C/C++
    - 

# Using R insdie C/C++
- On linux this is easy and well-documents
- On Windows, it's another story...
- I will show you how to do it on Windows,
- Once you know what to do, it is really easy

# Setting up the R API
- First you need `pexports` from MinGW.
    - We will use `pexports` to extract information from R.dll to create a list of symbols in the DLL
    - Then, we will use this file to generate an import library
- Go to MinGW.org to download the installer.  Then, install `pexports`.

\centerline{
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=0.5\textheight,keepaspectratio]{./figures/pexports.png}
}

# Setting up the R API
1. Create the exports definition file from R.dll 
- From the command prompt type
```
$ cd "C:\Program Files\Microsoft\MRO\R-3.3.0\bin\x64\R.dll"
$ pexports R.dll > R.exp
```
    - Note if pexports is not in your path, you will need to use the full path above
    
2. Then create the library file using VC++
```
$ lib /def:R.exp /out:Rdll.lib /MACHINE:X64
```
    - Now we can use this library in Visual Studio.
    
# Add the path to the R-Version\\include
- In Visual Studio, right-click the project to open up the property pages
- Add the path to the R header files

# Add the Rdll.lib dependency
- Property pages/linker/all options
- Add Rdll.lib to the additional dependencies
- Add its path to the additional library Directories

  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=0.7\textheight,keepaspectratio]{./figures/linkerOptions.png}
}


# R's random number generator in C++
```{Rcpp, eval=FALSE}
extern "C" void __cdecl randNorm(double *out)
{
    GetRNGstate();
		out[0] = norm_rand();
		PutRNGstate();
}
```
